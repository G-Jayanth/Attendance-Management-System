# Attedence Management System 
The Attendance Management System is a robust desktop application designed to digitally track and manage attendance records, typically for employees or students, moving away from manual methods to ensure better accuracy and ease of access. The project leverages a powerful three-tier architecture, utilizing Java Swing for the frontend to create an intuitive and user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI). This allows users (like administrators, faculty, or students) to seamlessly interact with various modules, such as login/authentication, recording daily attendance, and generating reports. All critical information, including user credentials, employee/student details, and daily attendance records, is reliably stored and managed in the MySQL database. The crucial link between the Java application and the MySQL backend is established using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). This standard Java API handles the connection, allows for secure execution of SQL queries (like INSERT for recording attendance or SELECT for generating reports), and ensures seamless data manipulation between the application logic and the permanent storage. Key features often include role-based access (Admin, Faculty, Student), real-time attendance status updates, and comprehensive reporting capabilities.
